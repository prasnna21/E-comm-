10  ## Example
11  
12  Get the first matching pair of braces:
13  
14  ```js
15  var balanced = require('balanced-match');
16  
17  console.log(balanced('{', '}', 'pre{in{nested}}post'));
18  console.log(balanced('{', '}', 'pre{first}between{second}post'));
19  console.log(balanced(/\s+\{\s+/, /\s+\}\s+/, 'pre  {   in{nest}   }  post'));
20  ```
21  
22  The matches are:
23  
24  ```bash
25  $ node example.js
26  { start: 3, end: 14, pre: 'pre', body: 'in{nested}', post: 'post' }
27  { start: 3,
28    end: 9,
29    pre: 'pre',
30    body: 'first',
31    post: 'between{second}post' }
32  { start: 3, end: 17, pre: 'pre', body: 'in{nest}', post: 'post' }
33  ```

35  ## API
36  
37  ### var m = balanced(a, b, str)
38  
39  For the first non-nested matching pair of `a` and `b` in `str`, return an
40  object with those keys:
41  
42  * **start** the index of the first match of `a`
43  * **end** the index of the matching `b`
44  * **pre** the preamble, `a` and `b` not included
45  * **body** the match, `a` and `b` not included
46  * **post** the postscript, `a` and `b` not included
47  
48  If there's no match, `undefined` will be returned.
49  
50  Liquid syntax error (line 50): Variable '{{ "{{a}" }}' was not properly terminated with regexp: /\}/



51  
52  ### var r = balanced.range(a, b, str)
53  
54  For the first non-nested matching pair of `a` and `b` in `str`, return an
55  array with indexes: `[ <a index>, <b index> ]`.
56  
57  If there's no match, `undefined` will be returned.
58  
59  If the `str` contains more `a` than `b` / there are unmatched pairs, the first match that was closed will be used. For example, `{{a}` will match `[ 1, 3 ]` and `{a}}` will match `[0, 2]`.
